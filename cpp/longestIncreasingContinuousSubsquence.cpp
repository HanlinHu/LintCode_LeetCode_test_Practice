/*
*
* name: Longest Increasing Continuous subsequence
*
* description:
* Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this array)ï¼Œ
* find the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array. 
* (The definition of the longest increasing continuous subsequence here can be from right to left or from left to right)
* 
* example:
* For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.
* For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.
* 
* note:
* O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
